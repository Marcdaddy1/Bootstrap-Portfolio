# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Using Bootstrap to recreate my portfolio site with the following items:
The website should include the following bootstrap components:


A Navigation bar


A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use bootstrap's navbar or create your own.


Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.

Links should navigate to the appropriate sections





A hero section

A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.



A work section


A section displaying my work in grid.


Use bootstrap cards for each project.

The description should give a brief overview of the work.



Each project will eventually link to your my project work!




A skills section

List out the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.



An about / contact section.

An "About Me" section in the same row.



A footer section.


All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.


All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.






My Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
